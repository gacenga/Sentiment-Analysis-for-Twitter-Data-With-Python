# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Twitter-Data-With-Python
This project involves collecting tweets related to a specific topic and performing sentiment analysis on them. The goal is to understand the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) associated with the topic on Twitter. We'll use Python, Tweepy for accessing the Twitter API, and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
